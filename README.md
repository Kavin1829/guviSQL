Iâ€™m worked on this project called "YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL and Streamlit." The main objective is to automate the collection, storage, and analysis of YouTube data. The project involves three key components:

Data Harvesting: Using the YouTube API to gather data such as video statistics, channel information, and user comments.
Data Warehousing: Storing the collected data in a SQL database to ensure it is organized and easily accessible.
Data Visualization: Utilizing Streamlit to create an interactive dashboard that allows users to visualize and analyze the YouTube data effectively.
This project aims to provide a comprehensive tool for content creators, marketers, and analysts to gain insights from YouTube data, helping them make informed decisions based on accurate metrics.
